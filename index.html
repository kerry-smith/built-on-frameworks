        <h2>Having a website that doesn't display nicely for all your customers, whether they be on mobile, tablets or desktops, is hurting your business. Front-end frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Foundation and many others, give developers the ability to streamline the process of building you a beautifully responsive website that everyone can enjoy.</h2>

        <h3>It's simple really...</h3>
        <p>A better user experience across all formats leads to increased engagement.  When you cast a wider net, you're able to increase your customer base. More eyeballs means more customers and more customers means potential for growing your business.  Now that's a win-win! The alternative is maintaining the status-quo, frustrating visitors to your website and having them spend their time and money elsewhere. No one wants that right?</p>
